# Notes About The Implementation
- Everything is coded in Visual Studio Code.
- Interaction is done through the Terminal, no GUI is involved.
- The CPU's actions are mostly random.

- Two player with another person (taking turns on same Terminal).
- Both options allow imports of pre-positioned ship textfiles for Player 1 and/or Player 2 (not for CPU).
