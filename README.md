# About
A battleship game using text-based representation. The rules and ship names follow the Hasbro version.

# Notes About The Implementation
- Everything is coded in Visual Studio Code.
- Interaction is done through the Terminal, no GUI is involved.
- The CPU makes use of a probability density function to determine its next move.
- There are two Battleship classes:
  - <b> Battleship: </b> the main class. It has the elements and methods to run a two player game.
  - <b> BattleshipCPU: </b> subclass of Battleship. It allows single player games against the CPU.

# Game Options
- Single player against the CPU.
- Two player with another person (taking turns on same Terminal).
- Both options allow imports of pre-positioned ship textfiles for Player 1 and/or Player 2 (not for CPU).
