A battleship game using text-based representation. Based on the guessing game of the same name.

# Notes About The Implementation
- Everything is coded in Visual Studio Code.
- Interaction is done through the Terminal, no GUI is involved.
- The CPU's actions are mostly random.

- Create a one player version against the computer, but the ship placements are random.
- Create a two player version.
- Import pre-defined ship positions using file handling.
